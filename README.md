Samples of source code from various sources, for testing my color palettes
([selenized](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized) and
[limestone](https://github.com/jan-warchol/limestone-colors)).

### Repo organization

Samples are grouped by their source of origin. Most important samples are
symlinked to the root dir; these should be used first when testing.
